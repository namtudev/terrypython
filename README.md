## L01: For Loops

Learn how to repeat actions using for loops in Python.

### Topics Covered

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Basic Structure | `for i in range(n):` syntax and indentation |
| range() | `range(stop)`, `range(start, stop)`, `range(start, stop, step)` |
| Loop Variable | Using `i` in calculations |
| Calculating with Loops | Sum, count with accumulator variables |
| Loops with Conditionals | Using `if` inside loops |
| Looping Through Strings | Iterating over characters |
| break and continue | Loop control statements |
| Nested Loops | Loops inside loops |
